## 1.

Plotting $f(x)$ with $c=2$ and $f_p(x)$ with $\alpha=2$ and $T_{min}=2$

```{r plot}
c = 2
t_min = 2
alpha = 2

plot(1, xlim = c(0,75), ylim = c(0, 1), type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "f(x) ~ f_p(x)")
curve(eval(c) * (sqrt(2 * pi)^(-1)) * exp(-eval(c)^(2) / (2 * x)) * x^(-3/2), from=0, to=75, add=TRUE, col="black")
curve((eval(alpha) - 1 / eval(t_min)) * (x / eval(t_min))^(-eval(alpha)), from=0, to=75, add=TRUE, col="red")

```

The power-law distribution should not be used by itself because for small values of $x$ $f_p(x) = \infty$. If we sample from our majorizing distribution in this area, we will get a huge number of rejections. It might be better to combine the power-law distribution with another distribution that majorizes our target function in that area. We could use a uniform distribution with support $(0, T_{min}$ in addition to our given distribution with support $(T_{min}, \infty)$.
